This is a list of scientific papers to which I have contributed or which were based on my research and ideas.
Due to my interest in the general principles of deep learning and neural networks, the topics range from deep dives into the inner workings to real-world applications of neural networks.
Certainly, the latter were influenced by the [projects](/projects) I was involved in and working on.
Moreover, my colleagues and I were full of excitement, pursuing rather exotic concepts.
Please see for yourself. :hugs:
