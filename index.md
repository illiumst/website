Hey, glad you found me!

This web page is intended to provide an overview of my current professional life as a doctoral student at the Ludwig Maximilian's University, Munich ([LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de)).  So, let's get right to the point!

Being at a university means being a teacher in classes, an advisor in practical classes, a speaker, or an organizer in lectures. On the respective pages, you can learn more about my [teaching](teaching) and my [research](research) topics.

Working on projects on behalf of or with partners from industry was another task. Here I learned about audio signal processing and the training of deep neural networks in the context of sequences and image data. In my final year, I was given the opportunity to study multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of safety and emergent phenomena in fused industrial environments.

Together with my personal interests, this formed the basis for the [publications](publications) we were fortunate enough to work on.

Over the course of my time, my colleagues and I came to work on what were called '*hobbies*', which led me to being the head organizer of a small [open-source conference](https://openmunich.eu).
Soon thereafter, I took over the editorial office of our [online magazine](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/). I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work in positionsI had never imagined.
