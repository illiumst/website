Here you will find an overview of the projects I worked on at the [mobile and distributed systems chair](http://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/).
I had multiple roles within my time, such as technician, researcher, project communicator, conference organizer, and editor-in-chief.
Therefore, this list consists of a mix of real industrial projects (in cooperation with SWA and Fraunhofer) and what we call “hobbies” within the chair's reach.
