This section details key projects undertaken during my tenure as a Research Assistant and PhD candidate at the [Chair for Mobile and Distributed Systems](http://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/), LMU Munich (2018-2024), as well as subsequent engagements.

My involvement spanned a diverse range of initiatives, encompassing foundational research, applied projects in collaboration with industry partners such as Stadtwerke MÃ¼nchen (SWM) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems (IKS), and significant contributions to academic community organization and outreach. Across these projects, I assumed various responsibilities, including researcher, technical lead, project communicator, conference organizer, and editorial lead.

The following list provides an overview of these varied engagements, highlighting the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes associated with each initiative.
