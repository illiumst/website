Here you will find an overview of the projects I worked on at the [mobile and distributed systems chair](http://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/). 
Throughout my tenure, I embraced various roles including technician, researcher, project communicator, conference organizer, and editor-in-chief. 
As a result, the list below represents a blend of genuine industrial projects, undertaken in collaboration with SWA and Fraunhofer, as well as pursuits we affectionately refer to as “hobbies” within the ambit of the chair.
