As a doctoral student, embracing the role of an educator brought me great joy, whether it was mentoring undergraduate and graduate students on their theses, assisting in the organization of larger lectures, or leading practical seminars and courses. Below is a list of subjects where I contributed either as an assistant or as the main instructor. 

For a detailed list of thesis topics I have supervised, please visit my [LMU profile page](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/team/steffen-illium/).
