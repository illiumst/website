Being a doctoral student, I was happy to also assume a teaching role, either as a mentor for undergraduate and graduate students' theses, an assistant for arranging larger lectures, or as a facilitator for practical seminars and courses.
Below, you'll find a list of subjects in which I played an assisting or leading role.
A comprehensive listing of past thesis topics can be accessed on my [LMU profile page](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/team/steffen-illium/).
