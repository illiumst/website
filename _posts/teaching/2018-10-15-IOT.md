In the context of the lecture [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/lehrveranstaltungen/iot-ws1819/), my task was to come up with a practical exercise which could be implemented in the scope of 1-2 classes. We went with a typical [MQQT](https://mqtt.org/) based communication approach, which incooperated an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) backend, while simulating some high frequency sensors.
The task was to implement this all from scratch in [Python](https://www.python.org/), which was tought in seperate [lecture](/teaching/Python/).

This practical course was held in front of about 200 students in winter 2018.
