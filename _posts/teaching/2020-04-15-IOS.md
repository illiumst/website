Building upon my experience supervising the [Android development practical course](/teaching/android), I also co-supervised the **"iOS Praktikum"** at LMU Munich. This hands-on lab course focused on native mobile application development for the Apple iOS platform using the **Swift** programming language.

The course was structured in two main phases:

1.  **Introductory Phase:** Covered foundational theoretical concepts of iOS development and Swift programming, complemented by practical exercises to solidify understanding.
2.  **Project Phase:** Students formed small teams to conceptualize, design, develop, and test their own iOS application ideas. Throughout this phase, I provided regular **individual guidance and technical support** to the teams, assisting with architectural decisions, debugging, and project management.

A significant emphasis was placed not only on technical implementation but also on software engineering practices relevant to mobile development.

  The Praktikum aimed to provide comprehensive experience in:
  <ul>
    <li>Native iOS development using Swift.</li>
    <li>Understanding specific concepts of mobile device programming (e.g., lifecycle, sensors, connectivity).</li>
    <li>Planning and executing timed software projects as a team.</li>
    <li>Applying agile development principles and utilizing associated tools.</li>
  </ul>
  Students progressed from guided exercises to independent team-based project realization.
