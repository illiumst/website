One semester and with the experience in [andropid app developement](teaching/android), I stepped in to support my collegue in teaching mobile app developement at LMU.
The lab was divided into two phases:
**1)** In the introductory phase, the theoretical basics were taught in a weekly preliminary meeting, in addition to practical timeslots.
**2)** During the project phase, students then worked independently in groups on their own projects.
There were individual appointments with the project groups to discuss the respective status of the project work.

Specifically, the practical course provided an introduction to programming for the Apple iOS operating system.
The focus was on programming with Swift and an introduction to specific concepts of programming on mobile devices.
