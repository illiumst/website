Leveraging my [android app developement](/teaching/android) experience, I contributed to teaching a mobile app development lab at LMU, focusing on iOS programming with Swift. 

The course had an introductory phase for theoretical basics and practical sessions, followed by a project phase where students worked in groups on their projects, with individual guidance provided.
Specifically, the practical course provided an introduction to programming for the Apple iOS operating system.
The focus was on programming with Swift and an introduction to specific concepts of programming on mobile devices.
