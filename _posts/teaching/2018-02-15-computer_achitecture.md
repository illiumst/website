We had a team of 10-12 tutors that were employed to balance the workload.
Also, we created each weeks graded exercise sheets as well as the written exam and organized it.

</div>This lecture provided an introduction to the technical foundations of computer science and the architecture of computers.
Topics introduced in the lecture include representation of information in computers, classical components of a computer, arithmetic in computers, logical design of computers, switching circuits, representation of memory contents, primary and secondary memories, input and output, and pipelining.
More concrete:

- Representation as bits: (numbers, text, images, audio, video, programs).
- Storage and Transfer of data, error detection and correction
- Boolean algebra
- Processing of data: circuit design, switching networks
- Number representation and arithmetic
- Switching functions, switching networks, switching plants
- Von Neumann model
- Machine model
- Machine and assembly language programming
- Introduction to Quantum Computing

This lecture was held by Prof. Dr. Linnhoff-Popien titled "Rechnerarchitektur" at [https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/](LMU).
