During my doctoral studies at LMU Munich, I served as a Teaching Assistant and took on significant organizational responsibilities for the undergraduate lecture **"Rechnerarchitektur" (Computer Architecture)**. This foundational course, led by Prof. Dr. Linnhoff-Popien, catered to approximately 600 students each semester.

My primary responsibilities focused on managing the tutorial component and supporting the overall lecture delivery:

*   **Tutorial Coordination:** Managed a team of 10-12 student tutors, including recruitment, training, task assignment, and ensuring equitable workload distribution to effectively support the large student cohort.
*   **Curriculum Support:** Designed weekly exercise sheets, including theoretical problems and practical programming tasks (e.g., assembly language), aligned with the lecture content. Coordinated the grading process across the tutor team.
*   **Examination Management:** Contributed to the design, organization, and supervision of the final written examinations, ensuring smooth execution for a large number of participants.

The course provided students with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of computer science and architecture.
