We had a team of 10-12 tutors that were employed to balance the workload.
Also, we created each weeks graded exercise sheets as well as the written exam and organized it.

</div>The lecture `Operating Systems` was a continuation of the lecture [`Computer Architecture`](teaching/computer_achitecture/) held in the summer semester.
The focus of the lecture lay on presenting the concepts of system programming.
This included the programming of the operating system and of service programs such as editors, compilers and interpreters.
The lecture provided an overview of the main tasks and problem around operating system, with particular emphasis on the areas of synchronization, process communication, kernel and memory management.
Java (in particular the Thread API) was used to teach the practical implementation of the concepts introduced in the lecture in the practical exercises.
At the end of the lecture, the architecture of distributed systems, cross-computer communication and remote procedure calls was discussed, also.

This lecture was held by Prof. Dr. Linnhoff-Popien titled `Betriebssysteme` at [LMU](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/).
