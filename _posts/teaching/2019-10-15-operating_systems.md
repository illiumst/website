</div>We developed weekly graded exercises and exams. This lecture, a continuation of [`Computer Architecture`](teaching/computer_achitecture/) focused on system programming concepts like OS programming, synchronization, process communication, and memory management. Practical exercises used Java, particularly the Thread API, and the course concluded with distributed systems architecture. Taught by Prof. Dr. Linnhoff-Popien at [LMU Munich](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/).
