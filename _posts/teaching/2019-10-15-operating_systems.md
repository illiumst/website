Following the introductory course on Computer Architecture, I also served as a Teaching Assistant and Tutorial Coordinator for the subsequent **"Betriebssysteme" (Operating Systems)** lecture at LMU Munich, taught by Prof. Dr. Linnhoff-Popien. This course typically enrolled 300-400 students per semester.

My role involved supporting the lecture and managing the associated tutorial sessions:

*   **Tutorial Coordination:** Led a team of 10-12 student tutors, organizing their schedules and ensuring consistent support for the students' learning process.
*   **Exercise & Examination Support:** Contributed to the development of weekly graded exercise sheets, focusing on practical application of theoretical concepts. Assisted in the preparation and administration of final examinations.

The lecture built upon the foundations laid in [Computer Architecture](/teaching/computer_achitecture/), delving into core operating system and system programming concepts. Practical exercises were primarily implemented in **Java**, making extensive use of the **Thread API** to illustrate concurrency concepts.
