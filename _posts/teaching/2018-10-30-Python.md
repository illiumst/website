In preparation for the practical exercises within the [Internet of Things (IoT) lecture series](/teaching/IOT/), we identified the need for foundational programming skills among the student cohort. Consequently, during the Winter Semester 2018/19, I **co-developed and co-taught** an intensive introductory course focused on the **[Python programming language](https://www.python.org/)**.

This "Python 101" module, delivered over four dedicated class sessions to approximately 200 students, was designed to equip them with the essential programming concepts required for the subsequent [IoT practical exercise](/teaching/IOT/).

The course structure balanced theoretical instruction with hands-on practical components to build coding proficiency. This preparatory course ensured that students possessed the necessary Python skills to successfully engage with and benefit from the more complex programming tasks in the main IoT lecture's practical sessions.

  The curriculum included:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Theoretical Lessons:</b> Covering core Python syntax, data types, control flow, functions, and basic programming principles.</li>
    <li><b>Practical Application:</b> Incorporating programming exercises designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge and build practical coding proficiency.</li>
  </ul>
  The focus was on providing the essential toolkit for tackling subsequent IoT-related programming tasks.
