The "Python 101"-Lecture was held within the context of the [IOT](/teaching/IOT/) lecture, held in winter semester 2018.
Over the course of four classes, we tought an extensive introduction to the [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) programming language.
Not only was the cource slides developed by me and my collegue, we also shared the lectures in front of about 200 students.

There was also a practical part of the course, which allowed students to the practical acquisition of programming skills in the `Python` programming language.
