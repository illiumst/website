During the winter semester of 2018, as part of the [IOT](/teaching/IOT/) lecture series, we conducted a "Python 101" course. This extensive introduction to [`Python`](https://www.python.org/), which I co-developed and co-taught, spanned four classes and reached approximately 200 students.

In addition to theoretical lessons, we incorporated a practical component to enhance students' programming skills in Python.
