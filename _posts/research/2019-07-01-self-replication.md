This text discusses the fundamental role of self-replication in biological structures and its application to neural networks for developing complex behaviors in computing. It explores different network types for self-replication, highlighting the effectiveness of backpropagation in navigating network weights and fostering the emergence of non-trivial self-replicators. The study further delves into creating an artificial chemistry environment comprising several neural networks, offering a novel approach to understanding and implementing self-replication in computational models.
