![Self-Replicator Analysis](\assets\figures\13_sr_analysis.jpg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Self-replicating neural networks can be trained to output a representation of themselves, making them navigate towards non-trivial fixpoints in their weight space. We explore the problem of adding a secondary functionality to the primary task of replication. We find a successful solution in training the networks with separate input/output vectors for one network trained in both tasks so that the additional task does not hinder (and even stabilizes) the self-replication task. Furthermore, we observe the interaction of our goal-networks in an artificial chemistry environment. We examine the influence of different action parameters on the population and their effects on the groupâ€™s learning capability. Lastly we show the possibility of safely guiding the whole group to goal-fulfilling weight configurations via the inclusion of one specially-developed guiding particle that is able to propagate a secondary task to its peers.
