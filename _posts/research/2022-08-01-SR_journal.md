This study extends previous work on self-replicating neural networks, focusing on backpropagation as a mechanism for facilitating non-trivial self-replication. It delves into the robustness of these self-replicators against noise and introduces artificial chemistry environments to observe emergent behaviors. Additionally, it provides a detailed analysis of fixpoint weight configurations and their attractor basins, enhancing the understanding of self-replication dynamics within neural networks.
