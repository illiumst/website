The segmentation and fitting of solid primitives to 3D point clouds is a complex task. Existing systems are restricted either in the number of input points or the supported primitive types. This paper proposes a hybrid pipeline that is able to reconstruct spheres, bounded cylinders and rectangular cuboids on large point sets. It uses a combination of deep learning and classical RANSAC for primitive fitting, a DBSCAN-based clustering scheme for increased stability and a specialized Genetic Algorithm for robust cuboid extraction. In a detailed evaluation, its performance metrics are discussed and resulting solid primitive sets are visualized. The paper concludes with a discussion of the approachâ€™s limitations.
