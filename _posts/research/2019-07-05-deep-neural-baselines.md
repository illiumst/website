The study presents an innovative end-to-end deep learning method to identify sleepiness in spoken language, as part of the Interspeech 2019 ComParE challenge. This method utilizes a deep neural network architecture to analyze audio data directly, eliminating the need for specific feature engineering. This approach not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models but is also adaptable to various audio classification tasks.
