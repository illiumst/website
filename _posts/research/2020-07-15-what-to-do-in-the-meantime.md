This analysis explores the concept of privately owned shared autonomous vehicles as a transitional phase towards a new transportation paradigm. It proposes two reachability analysis methods to assess the impact of utilizing privately owned cars during their typical long parking intervals, such as during an owner's work hours. By applying these methods to a dataset from the Munich area, the study reveals how time and location-dependent factors, like rush hours and urban vs. suburban differences, affect service coverage.
