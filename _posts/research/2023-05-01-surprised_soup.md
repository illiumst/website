This research explores artificial chemistry systems with neural network particles that exhibit self-replication. Introducing interactions that enable these particles to recognize and predict each other's behavior, the study observes emergent behaviors akin to stability patterns previously seen in explicit self-replication training. A unique catalyst particle introduces evolutionary pressure, demonstrating how 'social' interactions among particles can lead to complex, emergent outcomes.
