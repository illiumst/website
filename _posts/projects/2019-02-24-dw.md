During my time at LMU, I filled the position of Editor in Chief at [DIGITALE WELT Magazin (DW)](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de), where I supervised the online and social media content with my working students.
This medium has set itself the goal of combining both scientifically and economically relevant topics in one platform.
During my time, I implemented and streamlined the processes from the aquisition to the publication of externally sourced articles.
Within due time I manged to automate most of the previously time-consuming tasks to cut the overall workhours by half, while establishing a wider portfolio.
I also supervised the re-degsign and relaunch of the website during the transition to an online first medium.

In the years prior, I also supervised the content of the Magazins' "Knowledge"-section, which then was released in printed format. Those past Issues are still available [online](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/alle-magazine/).
