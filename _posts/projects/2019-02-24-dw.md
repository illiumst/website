As Editor in Chief at [DIGITALE WELT Magazin (DW)](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de) during my tenure at LMU, I oversaw online and social media content, aiming to blend scientific and economic discourse on a singular platform. I streamlined content acquisition and publication processes, significantly reducing workload through automation and broadening our content portfolio. My tenure also included overseeing a major website redesign and transition towards a digital-first approach.
