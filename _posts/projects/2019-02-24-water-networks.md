Collaborating with Munich City Services ([Stadtwerke München (SWM)](https://www.swm.de/)), our project focused on detecting leaks in water networks. We equipped Munich's suburban infrastructure with contact microphones to capture the sounds of potential leaks.

Our study highlighted technical challenges but also provided key insights. By transforming audio into mel spectrograms, we discovered that deep neural networks could identify crucial features more effectively than traditional machine learning methods, leading to further research publications.
