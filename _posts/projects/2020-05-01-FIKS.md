  In collaboration with Fraunhofer IKS, the AI-Fusion project addressed the critical challenge of understanding and ensuring safety in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems. Emergence, defined as the arising of complex, often unpredictable, system-level dynamics from local interactions between agents and their environment, was a central focus due to its implications for system safety and reliability.

  **Project:** AI-Fusion<br>
  **Partner:** [Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems (IKS)](https://www.iks.fraunhofer.de/)<br>
  **Duration:** 2022 - 2023<br>
  **Objective:** To investigate the detection and mitigation of potentially unsafe emergent behaviors in complex systems composed of multiple interacting AI agents, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous agents (e.g., mixed-vendor autonomous systems).

To facilitate research into these phenomena, key contributions included the development of specialized simulation tools:

**1. High-Performance MARL Simulation Environment:**

*   A flexible and efficient simulation environment was developed in Python, adhering to the [Gymnasium (formerly Gym) API specification](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/).
*   **Purpose:** Designed specifically for training and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms in multi-agent contexts prone to emergent behaviors.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Modularity:** Supports diverse scenarios through configurable `modules` and `configurations`.
    *   **Observation/Action Spaces:** Handles complex agent interactions, including per-agent observations and sequential/multi-agent action coordination.
    *   **Performance:** Optimized for efficient simulation runs, enabling extensive experimentation.

**2. Unity-Based Demonstrator Unit:**

*   A complementary visualization tool was created using the Unity engine.
*   **Purpose:** Allows for the replay, inspection, and detailed analysis of specific simulation scenarios and agent interactions.
*   **Utility:** Aids researchers in identifying and understanding the mechanisms behind observed emergent dynamics.

This project involved close collaboration with industry-focused researchers, software development adhering to modern standards, and deep investigation into the theoretical underpinnings of emergence and safety in MARL systems. The developed tools provide a valuable platform for continued research in this critical area.
