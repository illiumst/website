In cooperation with [Fraunhofer IKS](https://www.iks.fraunhofer.de/) this project aimed to investigate and detect emergent effects in multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios, i.e., mixed-vendor autonomous systems (AI fusion).
Emergence in general refers to emerging dynamics of higher complexity (i.e., sum), which are fed by interacting entities (each other and the environment) of a specific complexity level (regarding their policies and capabilities).

In this context, we developed a full-stack, high-performance environment in Python, following the [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/) specification for the training of reinforcement learning algorithms.

The main differentiation from already established MARL environments is its ability to employ various scenarios as a combination of `modules` and `configurations`. As well as the option to define per-agent observations, including placeholder and combined observation slices (grid-world). Moreover, this environment can handle multi-agent scenarios as well as sequential actions for inter-step observations.

Furthermore, we designed and implemented a [Unity demonstrator unit](https://github.com/illiumst/F-IKS_demonstrator) that can load and replay specific pre-recorded scenarios. This way, emerging unwanted and unsafe situations can be replayed and intuitively investigated.
