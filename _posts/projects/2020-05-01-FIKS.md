In cooperation with [Fraunhofer IKS](https://www.iks.fraunhofer.de/), this project explored emergent effects in multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios, such as mixed-vendor autonomous systems. Emergence, defined as complex dynamics arising from interactions among entities and their environment, was a key focus.

We developed a high-performance environment in Python, adhering to the [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/) specifications, to facilitate reinforcement learning algorithm training.

This environment uniquely supports a variety of scenarios through `modules` and `configurations`, with capabilities for per-agent observations and handling of multi-agent and sequential actions.

Additionally, a [Unity demonstrator unit](https://github.com/illiumst/F-IKS_demonstrator) was developed to replay and analyze specific scenarios, aiding in the investigation of emerging dynamics.
