**Key Outcomes & Contributions:**

*   **Research Advancement:** The project directly supported foundational and applied research activities at the LMU Chair, leading to numerous scientific [publications](/publications) across various domains within mobile and distributed systems.
*   **Knowledge Transfer & Networking:** InnoMi facilitated vital interactions between academia and industry. Within this framework, I contributed to the organization and management of key events designed to foster this exchange, including:
    *   [OpenMunich Conference](https://openmunich.eu) (2018-2019): Served as lead organizer.
    *   [DigiCon Conference Series](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/digicon/) (2018-2019): Provided organizational assistance.
*   **Dissemination & Editorial Leadership:** To further bridge the gap between cutting-edge digitalization trends and industry practitioners, I served as the Head of the Online Editorial Team for the associated [Digitale Welt Magazin (DW)](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/) from 2018 to 2023, a role supported by the InnoMi initiative.

This project provided a platform not only for advancing research but also for developing crucial skills in project communication, event management, and editorial leadership, directly contributing to the technology transfer goals of the Bavarian region.
