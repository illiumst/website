This research project ([Innomi](https:\\innomi.org)) as part of the [Zentrum Digitalisierung.Bayern (ZDB)](https://www.bayern-innovativ.de/de/unternehmen/zdb) builds on the various preliminary projects that were financed by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and took place with various Bavarian companies.
It aims to increase Bavaria's economic strength by transferring innovations from university to industry at an early stage.

Since 2016, [Innomi](https:\\innomi.org) serves as the funding backbone of research for the [Mobile Distributed Systems Chair](https:\\mobile.ifi.lmu.de). This allowed our team to perform research on various topics with students and industry partners. This resulted in many scientific contributions:

Additionally, and me in the role as editor in chief (online), [Digitale Welt Magazin (DW)](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de) fullfilled the purpose of connecting the industry to recent topics in the ongoing process of digitization.
Also *Innomi* allowed us to organize two conferences [Digicon](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/digicon/) and under my administration [OpenMunich](https://openmunich.eu/).
