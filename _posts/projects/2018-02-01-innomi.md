The [Innomi](https:\\innomi.org) research project, part of the [Zentrum Digitalisierung.Bayern (ZDB)](https://www.bayern-innovativ.de/de/unternehmen/zdb), enhances Bavaria's economy by fostering early innovation transfers from academia to industry. Funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and in collaboration with local companies, it has supported the [Mobile Distributed Systems Chair](https:\\mobile.ifi.lmu.de) since 2016, yielding numerous scientific publications across diverse research areas.

[Innomi](https:\\innomi.org) has also enabled the organization of conferences like [Digicon](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/digicon/) and [OpenMunich](https://openmunich.eu/), bridging industry and academia. My role extended to editing [Digitale Welt Magazin (DW)](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de), further linking current digitalization trends with industry needs.
