As Lead Organizer, I spearheaded the planning and execution of the OpenMunich conference series during 2018 and 2019. This event, organized by the LMU Chair for Mobile and Distributed Systems in collaboration with industry partners Accenture and Red Hat, aimed to create a forum for professionals, researchers, and students interested in the latest developments within the open-source ecosystem.

The conference provided a platform to showcase research emerging from the university, covering topics from Machine Learning to Quantum Computing, alongside practical insights and technology demonstrations from our industry partners.
