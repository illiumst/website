In collaboration with [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/de-de) and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), our chair hosted the [`OpenMunich`](https:\\openmunich.eu) conference, targeting professionals and students with an interest in open-source technologies. This event served as a platform for discussing our research, spanning topics from Machine Learning to Quantum Computing advancements.

Accenture and Red Hat not only provided financial backing but also contributed significantly to the program, offering sessions on `Ansible`, ML, and QC.

My responsibilities included organizing the infrastructure, coordinating with partners, colleagues, and external speakers, and managing the project's websiteâ€”overseeing its content, structure, and maintenance.
